# GetAWinner-Back - VÃ­ctor Aleman

Development of two APIs in Node.js where the methods to create, read, update and delete (crud) both users and competitors will be implemented. A modular structure based on models, routes, endpoints, controllers and middlewares was used.

On the other hand, for the operation of the APIs, a database will be built with MongoDB to store the data.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server (in the project directory): `nodemon start`.
